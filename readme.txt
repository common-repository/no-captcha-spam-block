Dramatically reduce comment spam on your blog without using a captcha.

== Description ==

No-captcha Spam Block is a WordPress plugin that automatically blocks comments it thinks are spam. It works tirelessly, day and night, applying various checks to each comment that comes in and giving it a spam score - any score too high and the comment goes straight to the spam bucket in disgrace.

* No third-party registration
* No JavaScript required
* Best of all, no captchas

There are no visible changes to your website and you don't need to set anything up - just install, activate and go!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `no-captcha-spam-block` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your server.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to sign up for an account? =

No, the plugin does not contact an external server so you don't need an account. It just sits on your server like a personal bodyguard that never gets tired.

= What will my users see? =

No captcha or other visible item is added to your blog so nothing will look different. A hidden element is added to the comment form but this doesn't affect what the user sees. It also won't affect your existing WordPress comment settings such as whether administrator approval is required, etc.

= Does it really work? =

It's not perfect so you may still get some spam comments coming through but these should be very few. It's designed to look for obvious signs of spam and it's pretty good at it (although I'm biased!) but it's also designed not to be too aggressive so it shouldn't block genuine comments.

= What about foreign language blogs or comments? =

No-captcha Spam Block is multi-talented and can block spam comments in any language, whatever language your website is in.
